# Children's Ministry

The Children's Ministry serves children from birth through 5th grade.

Our Preschool and Children's programs host a number of family-friendly events throughout the year including an Easter Egg Hunt, Vacation Bible School, and our Fall Trunk or Treat. Calvary Hills Baptist Church also partners with a number of organizations for children to participate.

## Sunday School for Preschool

On Sunday mornings, the Preschool program is open for children, birth through kindergarten. The children hear an age-appropriate Bible lesson, hear music, do a craft, and enjoy free play. We use the Bible Teaching for Kids curriculum.

The Preschool Ministry is also responsible for providing childcare during other activities at the church.

In order to allow the teachers to attend morning service, volunteers are needed. Volunteers are rotated on a monthly basis. 

**Security & Safety Note:**

Your child's safety is our highest priority. All volunteers and staff are requird to undergo background check before being allowed to working with any child under the age of eighteen.

When you arrive at the nursery, please sign-in your child and fill out a the safety sticker sheet. Both you and your child will have matching numbers. When you go to pick up your child, please have your number ready. Your child will not be allowed to leave with anyone unless they have the matching number.
