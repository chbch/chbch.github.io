## Sunday School for Preschoolers

On Sunday mornings, the Preschool program is open for children birth through kindergarten. The children hear an age-appropriate Bible lesson, hear music, do a craft, and enjoy free play. We use the Bible Teaching for Kids curriculum.

The Preschool Ministry is also responsible for providing childcare during other activities at the church.

In order to allow the teachers to attend morning service, volunteers are needed. Volunteers are rotated on a monthly basis. 

**Security & Safety Note:**

Your child's safety is our highest priority. All volunteers and staff are requird to undergo background check before being allowed to working with any child under the age of eighteen.
